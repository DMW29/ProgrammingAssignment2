## Computationally intensive operations consume resources and time.
## When the object on which these calculations are made remain unchanged,
## it is best to cache the calulation result.
## This function will calculate the inverse of a square, invertible matrix
## and cache it into memory.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
